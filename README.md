## Project Overview

The goal of this competition was to develop an effective noise removal algorithm capable of enhancing multiple real-world audio recordings corrupted by various types of noise. The challenge focused on improving audio quality through advanced denoising techniques while maintaining signal integrity.

Our team’s solution achieved **1st prize** by combining traditional signal processing methods with adaptive filtering and spectral analysis, implemented primarily in MATLAB.
